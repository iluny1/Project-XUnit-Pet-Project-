XCOM like game on Unity 2021.4

Main goal is to create a small game with XCOM-like tactical gameplay. 

I don't know, right now, what to do with stragetic-part (Base managment) of gameplay. 

After polishing main gameplay, I want to create weapon system (stats and visual upgrade), class system, character system, rank-upgrade system.
